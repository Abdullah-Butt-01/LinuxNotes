# Day 01 - Linux Basics

**Date:** 11-Jan-2026

## Objective

Learn what Linux is, basic Linux terminal navigation and file system commands.

## Commands Practiced

* pwd - print current directory
* ls - list files and folders

  * ls -| - detailed information
  * ls -a - show hidden files

* cd - change directory

  * cd ~ - home directory
  * cd .. - go up one level
  * cd folder\_name - go inside folder (use TAB to auto-fill name)

* mkdir - make directory

  * mkdir folder\_name - create single folder
  * mkdir -p name/name/name - create nested folders

* touch - create empty files
* nano - edit files in terminal

## what I did

* Opened WSL Terminal
* Navigated to directories
* Created Folders : mkdir -p ~/devops-learning/linux/day-01 and cd ~/devops-learning/linux/day-01
* Created and edited Markdown file for documentation using terminal

## Problems Faced

* Confused about current directory

## How I fixed

* Used 'pwd' to confirm location every time I felt confused
* Used 'TAB' key for auto-complete names

## Key Learnings

* Linux kernel vs Linux distribution
* Why Linux instead of Windows
* Linux is not commands. Linux is:
	- Files
	- Processes
	- Users
	- Permissions
	- Network
Commands are just tools to control these.
* Terminal commands are the core of devops
* Flag like -|, -a, -p improve efficiency
